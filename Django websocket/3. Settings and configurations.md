## Add channels to installed apps
Because channels has now been installed in out virtualenv, we can add it to 
our django project settings

```py
# in the settings.py
INSTALLED_APPS = [
	'chat',
	.....
]
```

## Changing out webserver from wsgi to asgi and integerating channels
Wsgi is a web server gateway interface: used for serving websites synchronously 
Asgi is Asynchronous server gateway interface: used for serving websites Asynchronously.

Now go into your asgi.py file and configure like so
1. First import ProtocalTypeRouter from channels.routing
	`` from channels.routing import ProtocalTypeRouter
2. Change the application to use the new ProtocalTypeRouter to tell django what to do on each protocol request "http" or "ws"
```py
# At the last line of the asgi.py
			application = ProtocolTypeRouter({
				'http': get_asgi_application() # already imported
			})
```

3. No we neet to go back to settings.py and point ASGI_APPLICATION it to asgi.py
	```py
	# in the settings.py
	ASGI_APPLICATION = '<project-name>.asgi.application'
	```

By doing all of this you have configured your project to handle asgi webserver.
