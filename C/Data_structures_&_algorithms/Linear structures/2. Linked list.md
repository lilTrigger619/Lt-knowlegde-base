# Linked list

# # About linked list.

It is a linear data structure. This ensure memory efficiency. Because elements can be stored per the memor availabily. Unlike an array the size is dynamic. This means the size of the array can change. The **start is know as *head***


## Applications
- Where memory is limited.
- Applications that require frequent insertions and deletions. (My manipulating nodes.)

## Types of linked list
- Singly linked list
	{ head } -> { data | next } -> { data | next } ->null
	only moves in one direction (forward).
 
- Doubly linked list
	{ head } -> { back | data | next } -> { back | data | next } -> null
	moves in both direction (forwards and backwards).
 
- Circular linked list
	{ head } -> { data | next } -> { data | next } -> points back to start
	alsmost same as singly linked list but goes back to the start on the last node.
 
### implementation Singly linked list.
Example.
```c
#include <stdio.h>

struct node{
	int data; // the data to be stored in the node.
	struct node *next; // the next node is a pointer to a struct type of node
} *temp

int main(){
	tmp = (struct node*) malloc(sizeof(struct node)); // allocation memory of same size as the node and casting the type o to the struct-node.
	 tmp->data = 1;
	 tmp->next = NULL;
	 printf("%d",tmp->data);
};
```

#### Insert to begining.
```c
#include <stdbool.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

struct node {
	int data;
	struct node* next;
} *Head, *tmp, *tmp1; // head and other tmp variables.

voide insert_begining(int value){
	if(Head = NULL){
		// when there is no head.
		tmp = (struct node*)malloc(sizeof(struct node));
		tmp->next = NULL;
		tmp->data = value;
	}else{
		// when there is already a head or more than one elem.
		tmp = Head; //first set head to a tmp pointer to struct.
		tmp1 = (struct node*)malloc(sizeof(struct node)); // allocate memory to the tmp1 and cast to type struct node.
		tmp1->next = tmp; // make tmp1's next to head
		tmp1->data = value; // make tmp1's data = the value.
		Head = tmp1; // finally swap the Head back as tmp1;
	};
};
```

The above function inserts element to the begining of the list.
- Should there be an item alread existing at the head of the list we can swap the value into another variable, create the new head and assign it's next to the old head which is referenced in a tmp variable.
- When there is no element at the head or when there is no value, just create a new one and assign it as head with it's next as a null.

#### Insert element to last 
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

struct node {
	int data;
	struct node next*;
} *Head, *tmp, *tmp1;

// function to insert element to the end of list.
void insert_end(int value){
	if(Head != NULL){
		tmp = Head; // bind Head to tmp variable.
		while(tmp != null){ // when tmp is not null
			tmp1 = tmp; // preserve the prev state to a tmp1 variable.
			tmp = tmp->null; // tmp to the next ele.
		};
		struct node* newLast = (struct node*)malloc(sizeof(struct node)); // create a new struct with allocated memory referencing it's memory.
		newLast->next = NULL;
		newLast->data = value;
		tmp1->next = newLast;
	}else{
		// when there is no element create a new one.	
		tmp = (struct node*)malloc(sizeof(struct node));
		tmp->next = NULL;
		tmp->data = value;
		Head = tmp;
	}
};
```

In the above code the function inserts to thelast element.
1. check if the list already has elements
2. if there are no elements create a new one and make it a Head.
3. If there are some existing elements, loop all the way to the element that has it's next value to null.
4. create a new element.
5. set the last element's next to the newly created element.

#### Remove first element
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

struct node {
	int data;
	struct node next*;
}*Head, *tmp, *tmp1;

//function to remove first element
int remove_first(){
	if(Head == NULL) return 0; // when there is no head.
	tmp = Head;
	Head = tmp->next; // head should be its next value.
}; // end of function
```

The function to remove an element at the begining of the list is quite simple.
1. when the head is null or empy return out of the function and do nothing.
2. when there is a head assign it to it's next to remove it.

#### Remove last element
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

struct node {
	int data;
	struct node next*;
}*Head, *tmp, *tmp1;

//function to remove last element
char remove_last(){
	if(Head == NULL) return 0; // when there is no head.
	if(Head->next == NULL){
		Head = NULL;
		return 0;
	}
	tmp = Head;
	// find the last item by checking each itm's next value for null.
	while(tmp->next != NULL){
		tmp1 = tmp;
		tmp = tmp->next;
	};
	tmp1->next = NULL;
}; // end of function
```
To remove the last element in the list, whe look for the Nulls in the next of each element
1. When looping the element with the it's next as null is the last element.
1. set the item to null when found.
