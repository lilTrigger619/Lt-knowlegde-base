# Intro.
Data structures are great way to make efficient use of memory when programming and algorithms makes is very convineint to solve programming issues.

## Types of data structures
1. linear data structure.
2. non-linear data structure.

### Linear data strucutres.
- Array
- Linked list
- Stack
- Queue

### Non-linear data structures.
- Binary Tree
- Binary Search Tree
- Graph
- AVL Tree
- RedBlack Tree etc.



- Arrangement in a non-sequencial manner.
